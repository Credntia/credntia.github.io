Credntia, LLC (“Credntia”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information while using our [website](http://credntia.com) and mobile applications (the “Service”). Credntia has established this Privacy Policy Statement to assist you to understand how we collect and use personally identifiable information if and when you use our Services or provide information to us in connection with your use of the Service as a “Subscriber”. By using our Services you are agreeing to the collection and use of personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy Statement. By registering for our Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy Statement and the Credntia Terms of Service.

## What Information Does Credntia Collect?

**Information You Provide:** When a Subscriber registers for the Service, we require a valid email address.

**Account:** When you use the Services, we collect certain information attached to your account. This information includes first and last name, email address, date of birth, gender, a profile image, and phone number.

**Cookies:** When you use the Services, we may use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Services to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Credntia to process your online transactions. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while using the Services other than the email address you provide. Session cookies also help us verify your identity and are required in order to use the Services. Credntia uses persistent cookies, that only Credntia can read and use, to identify you as a valid user of a Credntia Subscription plan and make it easier for you to log in to the Services. Analytical cookies and similar technologies are also used to allow Credntia to recognize how visitors move around the Web site and the Service when they’re using it. We use this information, which is aggregated and does not uniquely identify end users, to analyze trends, to troubleshoot the Web site and Service, to track end users’ movements while on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing these types of tracking technologies. This helps us improve the overall user experience. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our Privacy Policy Statement; we do not have access or control over these cookies.

**Clear Gifs:** We may also use third party advertising and tracking tools that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the movements of the visitors to our Web site. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Visitors and Subscribers in order to optimize and enhance the Web site and Service experience. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**Log Files:** As is true of most Web sites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, but is not limited to, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

**Analytics:** Beyond account data, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes. This information includes, but is not limited to, how many credentials of different types have been added, which login methods are attached to your account, which login method was last used, and which register method was last used.

**HTML5:** We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use local storage objects (HTML5) to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 Local Storage.

## How Does Credntia Use My Information?

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
